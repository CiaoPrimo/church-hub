# Church Communication & Staff Management App

This project is a **custom web application** built for church communication and staff coordination.  
It is designed with simplicity, speed, and clarity in mind, so that church staff can communicate effectively with parents, altar servers, and one another ‚Äî all through one shared platform.

---

## üìñ Overview

The app provides a centralized way to send and receive email communications while maintaining clear staff identity.  
Instead of staff using multiple personal accounts, all outgoing and incoming messages are routed through **one church email address**. Each message is automatically tagged with the staff member‚Äôs name, so recipients know exactly who they are talking to.

From the dashboard, staff can:
- Send notifications or announcements in bulk to groups of recipients.
- Ensure each recipient gets an individual, separate email (not a group thread).
- Receive replies directly in the system, organized by the staff member responsible.
- Maintain secure access with **role-based logins** and configurable permissions.

The app is tailored to a church environment. For example:
- **Sacristans** can send altar server schedules and updates directly to parents.  
- **Admins** and higher roles can oversee communications and adjust settings.  
- **Parents of altar servers** can receive schedules, updates, and messages without confusion.
